Covering Codes
++++++++++++++

Introduction
============

This repository contains a collection of results of *Covering Codes*.
It tries to be as complete as possible and also lists historical
results.  A special case of this problem is the *Football Pools Problem*.

This is IMHO the first try to systematically collect the results in a
machine readable form.

Problem Description
===================

"In coding theory, a covering code is a set of elements (called
codewords) in a space, with the property that every element of the
space is within a fixed distance of some codeword."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_code

Results
=======

Each result is placed in a yaml file.  It is noted if it is a
solution, an upper bound or a lower bound.

The *results* directory contains the results with the following
sorting:

results/q/R/n

where *q* is the alphabet size, *R* is the maximal distance, and *n*
is the size (dimension).

Motivation
==========

During my mathematics and computer science studies in the 1990 I first
got in contact with this topic.  One of the first technical papers I
ever read was the one from Willes_ which was in a seminar to a
computer science course.  My thesis was about Simulated Annealing
where also this problem class was part of my studies.

I'm fascinated how fast a simple problem gets that big and complex
that only very few results are known.
